1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K

```go
func smallestRepunitDivByK(k int) int {
    // 如果 k 是偶数或者以 5 结尾，那么一定不存在这样的正整数，直接返回 -1。
    if k % 2 == 0 || k % 5 == 0 {
        return -1
    }
    // cur 代表当前的余数，初始值为 0，res 代表数字 1 的个数，初始值为 1。
    cur, res := 0, 1
    
    // 不断计算下一个数字的余数，直到找到一个可行的解或者发现不存在可行的解。
    for {
        cur = (10 * cur + 1) % k
        if cur == 0 {
            return res
        }
        res++
    }
}
