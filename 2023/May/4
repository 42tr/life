impl Solution {
    pub fn max_total_fruits(fruits: Vec<Vec<i32>>, start_pos: i32, k: i32) -> i32 {
        fruits.iter().enumerate().fold((0, 0, 0), |(mut i, mut sum, mut ans), (j, f)|{
            sum += f[1];
            while i <= j && f[0] - fruits[i][0] + (f[0] - start_pos).abs().min((start_pos - fruits[i][0]).abs()) > k{
                sum -= fruits[i][1];
                i += 1;
            }
